> Build a full-stack web app called **“On-Chain CV Proof Vault”** using JavaScript/TypeScript on Replit.
>
> ## Goal
>
> The app lets a **candidate**:
>
> 1. Upload their **CV as a PDF**
> 2. Store it on **Walrus** (or simulate Walrus storage if SDK is not available)
> 3. Compute a **hash** of the CV file
> 4. Register a **proof record** on Sui (or simulate it) that includes:
>
>    * `fileHash`
>    * `contentId` or `storageUrl` from Walrus
>    * `walletAddress` (typed manually for now)
>    * `timestamp`
> 5. Get a **shareable link** like:
>
>    * `https://cvproof.app/p/<proofCode>`
> 6. Optionally also see the **tx hash / proof code** that can be pasted into a job application.
>
> A **recruiter** should be able to:
>
> 1. Open the share link (e.g. `/p/<proofCode>`)
> 2. See:
>
>    * A verified summary of the CV proof (wallet, timestamp, hash, etc.)
>    * A button or link to **view/download the CV** from Walrus (or simulated storage)
>
> The first version can fully mock Walrus and Sui, but the architecture must make it easy to plug real SDKs later.
>
> ---
>
> ## Architecture
>
> * Use **Node.js + Express** for the backend.
> * Use **React** for the frontend, all inside Replit:
>
>   * `/client` for frontend
>   * `/server` for backend
> * Use environment variables (`.env`) for any future RPC URLs or API keys.
> * Separate integration logic into:
>
>   * `server/services/walrusService.ts`
>   * `server/services/suiService.ts`
>
> If direct Walrus / Sui integration is not practical in Replit, implement **mock services**:
>
> * `uploadCVToWalrus(file)`
>
>   * returns `{ contentId, storageUrl }` (fake but stable for demo)
> * `registerCVProofOnSui({ fileHash, contentId, walletAddress })`
>
>   * returns `{ txHash, proofCode }`
> * `getProofByCode(proofCode)`
>
>   * returns the stored proof record or `null` if not found
>
> Store proof records in a simple data layer (in-memory array or SQLite/JSON) with fields:
>
> * `id`
> * `walletAddress`
> * `fileHash`
> * `contentId`
> * `storageUrl`
> * `txHash`
> * `proofCode`
> * `createdAt`
>
> Please clearly comment where real Walrus/Sui SDK calls would be plugged in later.

> ## Core Features
>
> ### 1. Landing Page
>
> * App name: **On-Chain CV Proof Vault**
> * Two primary buttons:
>
>   * “Register CV” (for candidates)
>   * “Verify / View CV” (for recruiters)
>
> ### 2. “Register CV” Flow (Candidate)
>
> * Page route: e.g. `/register`
> * Form fields:
>
>   * File upload (PDF only)
>   * Wallet address (text input, no wallet connect required yet)
> * On submit:
>
>   1. Backend uploads file using `uploadCVToWalrus` (or mock)
>   2. Backend computes a hash of the PDF (e.g. SHA-256)
>   3. Backend calls `registerCVProofOnSui` (or mock) and gets `{ txHash, proofCode }`
>   4. Backend saves the full record in the local data store.
>   5. Frontend shows a **success screen** with:
>
>      * “Your CV Proof Code (TX Hash)”
>      * The **shareable URL**: e.g. `https://<app-domain>/p/<proofCode>`
>      * Copy-to-clipboard buttons for both.
>
> ### 3. “View / Verify CV” Flow (Recruiter)
>
> * There are two ways to use it:
>
>   1. Direct link: `/p/<proofCode>`
>   2. A simple page `/verify` where the recruiter can paste a proof code.
> * Backend:
>
>   * `GET /api/proof/:proofCode`
>   * Looks up the record via `getProofByCode`
> * Frontend (proof page):
>
>   * If found:
>
>     * Show:
>
>       * Wallet address
>       * Created at (formatted timestamp)
>       * File hash (shortened)
>       * Tx hash / proof code
>       * A button “View CV” → opens `storageUrl` in a new tab
>     * A small badge like “Proof verified (mocked on-chain)”
>   * If not found:
>
>     * Show a clear error: “No CV proof found for this code.”
>
> ---
>
> ## UI / UX Requirements
>
> * Clean, professional look (suitable for recruiting / HR context).
> * Basic layout:
>
>   * Header with app name and navigation links (“Register”, “Verify”).
>   * Centered cards for the forms.
> * Use a neutral color palette (white/grey) with a single primary accent.
> * Include loading states and error messages for network actions.
>
> ---
>
> ## Extra (Optional)
>
> If time allows:
>
> * A “My Proofs” page where a user can enter their wallet address and see previous CV proofs associated with that wallet.
> * Simple validation:
>
>   * Reject non-PDF uploads
>   * Require wallet address and file
>
> ---
>
> ## What I want from you (Replit)
>
> * Scaffold the client/server project and wire them together.
> * Implement the full `Register CV` and `View/Verify` flows end-to-end with mocked Walrus/Sui services.
> * Add clear comments in the code indicating where real Walrus and Sui SDK integrations should be placed later.
> * Make the project runnable with a single “Run” command in Replit.
>
> Start by creating the base project structure, then implement the backend routes and frontend pages step by step.
